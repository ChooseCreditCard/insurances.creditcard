    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>Understanding Credit Card Insurance</h2>
      <p>
        Credit card insurance is usually <strong>secondary coverage</strong> tied to card usage.
        It applies only when a trip or purchase is made using the card — and the details differ
        widely between issuers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Typical categories include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Travel insurance:</strong> medical, trip delay, cancellation, lost baggage.</li>
        <li><strong>Rental car insurance:</strong> collision damage waiver (CDW) or LDW.</li>
        <li><strong>Purchase protection:</strong> damage/theft coverage after buying an item.</li>
        <li><strong>Extended warranty:</strong> additional 1–2 years warranty on eligible items.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Always read the actual policy. Coverage amounts, exclusions and activation requirements
        vary dramatically.
      </p>

    <!-- Travel insurance -->
    <section id="travel" class="section">
      <h2>How Travel Insurance on Credit Cards Works</h2>
      <p>
        Travel insurance can be extremely valuable — but only when you understand the rules.
        Most cards require that you <strong>pay for the trip with the card</strong> to activate coverage.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Trip delay:</strong> reimbursement for meals, hotels and necessities.</li>
        <li><strong>Trip cancellation:</strong> non-refundable tickets if you must cancel.</li>
        <li><strong>Lost baggage:</strong> compensation for belongings after airline issues.</li>
        <li><strong>Emergency medical:</strong> varies widely — some include very limited coverage.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Many countries require separate medical travel insurance, so card coverage is often a complement, not a substitute.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Purchase + Warranty -->
    <section id="purchase" class="section">
      <h2>Purchase Protection & Extended Warranty</h2>
      <p>
        When you buy an item with your card, you may get temporary protection against theft
        or accidental damage — usually for 90 days.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Purchase protection:</strong> covers accidental damage or theft after purchase.</li>
        <li><strong>Extended warranty:</strong> adds 1–2 years to the manufacturer’s warranty.</li>
        <li><strong>Return protection:</strong> allows returning items even if the store refuses.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The limits depend on the card tier — premium cards often have higher maximum payouts.
