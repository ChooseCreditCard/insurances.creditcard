          Many cards advertise “free travel insurance” and strong protections — but the details live in fine print. This page explains the main types of cover, key exclusions and what to check before you rely on card insurance.

    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Is Credit Card Insurance?</h2>
      <p>Credit card insurance is a set of built-in or optional policies that apply when you use the card for certain purchases or trips. Typical examples include travel insurance, purchase protection, extended warranty and rental car coverage.</p>
      <p>These benefits are usually underwritten by a third-party insurer, not the card issuer itself. Coverage is triggered only when specific conditions are met — for example using the card to pay most or all of a trip, or registering a rental agreement in the primary cardholder’s name.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Types of Insurance -->
    <section id="types" class="section">
      <h2>Main Types of Card Insurance and Protection</h2>
      <p>Not every card includes every benefit, and limits vary widely. The list below covers the most common categories you will see in card documentation.</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Travel insurance:</strong> May cover medical emergencies, trip cancellation, delays, lost baggage and accident cover when you pay for the trip with the card.</li>
        <li><strong>Purchase protection:</strong> Short-term protection if a newly bought item is stolen or accidentally damaged within a defined period after purchase.</li>
        <li><strong>Extended warranty:</strong> Extends the manufacturer’s warranty on eligible electronics or appliances for a set period, subject to price and product limits.</li>
        <li><strong>Rental car insurance:</strong> Often a collision damage waiver when you pay for the rental with the card and decline the rental desk’s own coverage.</li>
        <li><strong>Chargeback and dispute rights:</strong> The ability to dispute unauthorized or faulty transactions under card network rules.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Claims & Limitations -->
    <section id="claims" class="section">
      <h2>How Claims Work – and Where Limitations Appear</h2>
      <p>To use card insurance, you typically file a claim with the insurer, not the card issuer. You may need to provide receipts, booking confirmations, police reports, medical documentation or repair estimates depending on the incident.</p>
      <p>Every policy contains exclusions and caps: age limits, pre-existing medical conditions, caps on coverage amounts, country exclusions, maximum item prices and strict time limits for reporting an incident. If those conditions are not met, the claim can be denied even though the card is advertised with “free insurance”.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Value & Strategy -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>When Card Insurance Adds Real Value</h2>
      <p>Card insurance can be valuable if you travel regularly, often rent cars or buy higher-value items that benefit from purchase protection and extended warranty. In those cases, embedded cover may reduce the need for separate standalone policies.</p>
      <p>However, relying solely on card insurance can be risky if your situation is more complex — for example extended trips, adventure travel, pre-existing medical conditions or expensive specialist equipment. In those scenarios, a dedicated policy tailored to your needs may still be necessary.</p>
